                <p class="content-part">
                    <em><strong>Cookies</strong></em> are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and
                    password — that are used to
                    identify
                    your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to
                    identify
                    specific users and improve your web browsing experience.
                    Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with an
                    ID
                    unique to you and your computer.
                    When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server reads the ID
                    and
                    knows
                    what information to specifically serve to you.

                </p>
                <h2 class="head-themes">Some examples of cookie types:</h2>
                <h3>Supercookie</h3>
                <p class="content-part">
                    <em><strong>A Supercookie</strong></em> is a cookie with an origin of a top-level domain (such as
                    .com)
                    or a public suffix (such
                    as .co.uk). Ordinary cookies, by contrast, have an origin of a specific domain name, such as
                    example.com. Supercookies can be a potential security concern and are therefore often blocked by web
                    browsers.
                </p>
                <h3>Zombie cookie</h3>
                <p class="content-part">
                    <em><strong>A zombie cookie</strong></em> is a cookie that is automatically recreated after being
                    deleted. This is accomplished by
                    storing the cookie's content in multiple locations, such as Flash Local shared object, HTML5 Web
                    storage, and other client-side and even server-side locations. When the cookie's absence is
                    detected,the cookie is recreated using the data stored in these locations.
                </p>
                <h2 class="head-themes"> Cookies and privacy:</h2>
                <p class="content-part">

                    Under the GDPR, it is the legal responsibility of website owners and operators to make sure that
                    personal data is collected and processed lawfully.
                    A website outside of the EU is required to comply with the GDPR if it collects data from users
                    inside
                    the EU.
                    Although cookies are mentioned only once in the GDPR, cookie consent is nonetheless a cornerstone of
                    compliance for websites with EU-located users.
                    This is because one of the most common ways for personal data to be collected and shared online is
                    through website cookies. The GDPR sets out specific rules for the use of cookies.
                    If you want to verify your webpage compliency with GDPR regulations, <em><strong>you can use
